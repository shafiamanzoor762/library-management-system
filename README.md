# library-management-system
Library Management System is a console base java application using OOP concepts and use files to manipulate data

 Overview
 Your code from Part 3 should successfully read in data from various files including 
items_and_user_data.txt into your model. We are now going to add more functionality to the model. 
So, in this part of the project, you will 

 Change the way that we store our data;
 introduce a new class that allows a library user to borrow an item for a specified period of time.  To 
assist this, we will make use of
 o a DateUtil class that provides functionality for dealing with dates and the Date class of 
java.util; 
o a Diary class that provides useful features for storing borrowings.
 Again, read ALL of each step before you start to code
 Step 1 = lots to read but mostly explanation üòä
 In this step we will change the way that we store our data. When you do make these changes, do not delete the old 
declarations and any other ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù code ‚Äì simply comment these out ‚Äì so that we can allocate marks to this 
code (as well as to your new code). 
The library users and library items are currently stored in two ArrayList objects, one for the items and a second 
for the library users. In Slides 12, we saw how an ArrayList implements the List interface.  This means that 
your two ArrayListobjects can also be regarded as being of type List.  We saw a somewhat similar situation in 
Chapter 10 with the Network project where MessagePost and PhotoPost objects could also be regarded as 
being of type Post.
 To check this, make appropriate changes to the declarations of the ArrayList fields in the Library class so 
that they are now of type List.  Check that your code still compiles and executes correctly.  Nothing has really 
changed as the two lists still reference array list objects ÔÅä
 An interface such as List allows a type of multiple inheritance, as discussed in Chapter 10, but it is important to 
remember that the add() method is not inherited by the classes ArrayList and LinkedList.  Instead, the fact 
that the classes implement the interface implies that they must each provide an add() method consistent with the 
one specified by List. Although the ArrayList and LinkedList classes all implement the List interface, they 
have different ways of storing the elements of a list and each has their own advantages and disadvantages.  
In our model, all instances of the LibraryUser class have a field userID that is intended to uniquely identify 
each library user.  Similarly, all LibraryItem objects should have a field itemCode that uniquely identifies 
them.  If we are going to have these unique identifiers, it makes sense to re-think the way that we store library 
users and items.  Recall Slides 6.23-27 that gave examples of key/value pairs and briefly discussed mappings and 
the HashMap class.  This class is also an example of a class that implements an interface, in this case the Map 
interface. 
We can regard the Map interface as playing the same role for "mappings" as the List interface plays for "lists" 
and any class that implements it will be able to store key/value pairs.  A very significant feature of a mapping is 
that the value corresponding to a given key can be easily retrieved, unlike retrieving objects from a list where it is 
necessary to search through the list to find the object you want.  
One advantage of using Maps instead of Lists is that it will be a simple matter to easily retrieve a LibraryUser 
object corresponding to a given userID or a LibraryItem object corresponding to a given itemCode. Hence, 
we will now make the change to the way that we store the library users and item and use a Map instead of a List.

Keeping your declarations for List, start coding by adding two new variables customerMap and itemsMap. 
Re-read Slides 6.23-27, and think carefully about your choice of key value. These new declarations more 
accurately reflect, in the code, how the customers and items are now stored but users of the system can still think 
of having a "list of customers" and a "list of items". 
So, just as we needed earlier, a particular type of List (e.g. ArrayList or LinkedList) in which to store the 
library users and items, we now need a particular type of Map.  We have seen a HashMap used in the Tech Support 
System project of Chapter 6 so we will choose to use a HashMap at this point.  If we decide later that it is not the 
best choice then, if you have coded sensibly, it is not difficult to change to another kind of Map (in a similar way 
to changing the kind of List earlier in this step).  
Next, in addition to the two existing calls to the constructor of the ArrayList class (which you should now 
comment out), add two new calls to an appropriate constructor of a different class.  
Unfortunately, even if you perform these changes correctly, it is not possible to check your work (at the moment) 
since you will find that your code will no longer compile.  
So, you will need to go through your code making necessary modifications.  No major changes are needed, 
simply changes to "details" e.g. unlike a List, a Map does not have an add() method so you will need to 
replace statements such as  
itemList.add(libraryItem);
 by some appropriate alternative.  However, you will probably find it useful know that the values() method of a 
Map object returns a "collection view" (e.g. a List) of the objects stored in a Map. 
When you can successfully compile the project, test that the code executes correctly.  You should be able to read 
in data, display library items and library users, write out user data in much the same way as you could at the end 
of Part 3 of the project.  
Step 2
 The purpose of this step is to explore the Date and DateUtil classes. The DateUtil class can now be 
downloaded from BlackBoard and added to your project. This class imports the Date class which is in the 
standard Java libraries.
 An instance of the Date class "represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision" (see html 
documentation for the class) and can be used, together with classes such as Calendar, GregorianCalendar 
and SimpleDateFormat, to represent and manipulate dates and times.  In this project, we will concentrate on 
using it to represent simply "dates" (e.g. 28/02/2024) rather than "dates and times" (e.g. 28/02/2024 14:59). 
Open the project into which you downloaded the class DateUtil and read the introductory javadoc comments. 
Note the following:

 The first two methods convertDateToLongString() and convertDateToShortString() convert 
Date objects to easily understandable strings e.g. "Wednesday, 28 February 2024" and "28-02
2024" where the "style" of the "long" and "short" versions of a date is determined by the fields 
longDatePattern and shortDatePattern. 
o Do not change these patterns because Library expects dates in these styles !  However it is 
clear that alternative "styles" are possible and the class could easily be enhanced by adding 
setlongDatePattern() and setshortDatePattern() methods.  
The convertStringToDate() method converts a string, in the style "28-02-2024", to a 
corresponding Date object.  We do this because such dates can easily be "manipulated" e.g. the 
following code 
Date today = DateUtil.convertStringToDate("28-02-2024");
 Date todayWeek = DateUtil. incrementDate(today, 7);
 System.out.println(DateUtil.convertDateToLongString(todayWeek));
 will output "Wednesday, 6 March 2024" to the terminal window.
 Give yourself confidence in using this class by looking at all the methods and reading their documentation. Once 
you have done this, (assuming you have added this class to your project), write code in your Test class that calls 
the method convertStringToDate() twice and then, using your two Date objects, calls the daysBetween() 
method and prints out the number of days between the two dates that you have chosen.

 We shall now use these classes to allow library users to borrow an item.
 Step 3
 A user can already use the library's printAllItems() method to see the items in the library and, having seen 
them, that user may then wish to borrow a particular item such as a DVD or a specialist book.  Such a reservation 
will need to specify the library user, the item, the start date for the reservation and the number of days the item is 
to be borrowed for.  It will also be convenient to give each reservation a unique id -- in this case we will store a 
six digit numerical string which will be generated sequentially e.g. 000001, 000002, 000003, 000004, etc
 So, you should now introduce an LibraryReservation class with:
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 three fields reservationNo, itemCode, userID, all of type String;
 a field startDate of type Date: the date of the first day of the reservation;
 a field noOfDays: the duration of the reservation.
 Next write the code for the constructor for the LibraryReservation class which should have five parameters 
reservationNo, itemCode, userID, startDate and noOfDays, in the order specified here.  The type of each 
parameter should be the same as the corresponding field except for the startDate parameter which should be of 
type String.  The argument passed for the startDate parameter should be in the shortDatePattern style 
mentioned above e.g. "28-02-2024".
 Any reservations that are made will need to be stored in the library so next you need to modify the Library class 
to handle the reservations by following these steps:
 ÔÇ∑
 Introduce a libraryReservationMap field to store the reservations.
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 Write a simple storeLibraryReservation() method similar to the storeItem() method (not the 
storeUser() method which is more complicated).  You should assume that the 
LibraryReservation object passed to the method will have a unique reservationNo.
 Write a method generateReservationNo() which generates the unique reservation number for a 
reservation. You should also "pad out" your numbers with zeros to produce, for example, 000001, 
000002, 000003, 000004, etc.
 o If we close our model then we should save our last generated number to a file so that we could 
then read it back in when we reopened the model. However, let‚Äôs leave that for now. ÔÅä 
o If this step proves too difficult, simply generate any random number & move on to the next 
bullet point.
 Write a getLibraryReservation() method.
 Add a method with the following header
 public void makeLibraryReservation(String userID, String itemCode, 
String startDate, int noOfDays)
 Initially the method should simply  
o get a reservation number for the reservation;
 o create an LibraryReservation object;
 o add it to the list of reservations.
 However, it is obvious that not all attempts to make a reservation will be valid -- for example, there may 
not be an item corresponding to the id passed to the method.  So make the method return a boolean, 
rather than void, and add checks at the beginning of the method to make sure that the four parameters 
are passed valid values:
 o if they are valid, the method should return true;
 o otherwise the method should output a message to the terminal window and return false 
without creating an LibraryReservation object, etc.
 There is also the possibility that a particular item may have already been reserved for all or part of the 
reservation period.  Do not attempt to check for this situation, we will return to this issue later

 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 Add methods printDetails() and printLibraryReservations() to the LibraryReservation 
and Library classes respectively.  These methods allow you to check that a "valid" reservation has been 
correctly added to the reservation list.
 Finally for this step, add methods writeLibraryReservationData() and 
readLibraryReservationData() to the Library class.  These methods should be similar to the 
writeUserData() method and will need writeData() and readData() methods in the 
LibraryReservation class. You should be able to copy and paste much of the code ÔÅä but note that 
you will need to use the DateUtil class to convert Date objects to and from String objects.
 The following step of the project is not needed for later steps of the project so it may skipped if you 
find it too difficult though marks are allocated to this step.
 Step 4
 If reservations were for one day only then it would be possible to easily check to see if an item selected by the 
library user was free on a particular day.  But reservations will typically span a number of days and that will make 
the checking more difficult e.g. the library item that a user might want to hire may be available on some days but 
not on others.  To overcome this problem and to provide other features, we have written a class Diary that can be 
downloaded from BlackBoard and added to the project.  A Diary object, as its name suggests, represents a diary 
which stores the reservations that have been made and the class provides the following public methods:
 public void addLibraryReservation(LibraryReservation reservation)
 public void printEntries(Date startDate, Date endDate)
 public void deleteLibraryReservation(LibraryReservation reservation)
 public LibraryReservation[] getLibraryReservations(Date date)
 Open the class and examine the Javadoc documentation which gives a brief description of each of these methods.  
If you scroll down the code, you will find at line 120, that the class contains an inner class, called DayInDiary:
 ÔÇ∑
 Just as a class can have fields, constructors and methods, it can also contain inner classes.
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 ÔÇ∑
 It would have been possible to make DayInDiary a public class in the usual way but sometimes there 
are advantages in having an inner class: 
o in this case, the class is introduced only to help produce the functionality of the Diary class, it 
is never accessed (directly) by, for example, the Library class;
 o making it an inner class makes it private (it is not possible to have an inner public class) and 
so improves encapsulation, see Chapter 8. 
The class DayInDiary itself contains yet another inner class, Entry !  However, note that the code 
could have been written slightly differently by making Entry an inner class of Diary rather than of 
DayInDiary.  But in its present form, it again improves encapsulation.
 Although the inner classes are private and have fields, constructors and methods declared to be private, 
the private modifier does not affect accessibility in the usual way for inner classes.  Fields and 
methods are freely accessible between the outer and inner classes: e.g. an inner class can access a private 
field in Diary and vice-versa !
 Note: you should NOT make any changes to the Diary class.
 To make use of this class, add a field diary to Library, initialise it in the constructor and add a call to the 
Diary class's addLibraryReservation() method in the storeLibraryReservation() method.  Whenever 
you now "make a reservation" using the makeLibraryReservation() method, the reservation will also be 
added to the "diary".  However, remember that we are not storing the reservation objects "twice" and using, 
potentially, a lot of memory: both the LibraryReservationMap and diary objects are merely storing the 
addresses of (or "pointers to") the same LibraryReservation objects.
 Compile and depending on whether you have been continuing with your accessor methods then your code should 
compile.
 Now write a new method for the Library class, printDiaryEntries() with String parameters, that calls the 
printEntries() method of the Diary class.  This will enable a user of the system to display diary entries for a 
specified period.  You might find it convenient to add a toString() method to the LibraryReservation class 
that returns a string combining the reservationNo, userId and itemID in an easily readable form.  Note that, 
for the purposes of this project, a reservation for a one day period (i.e. noOfDays is equal to 1) will have the same 
start and end date.
 Finally, for this step
 amend the makeLibraryReservation() method so that it is not possible to make the reservation if the 
item is already reserved for all or part of the reservation period.  Hint: think how you would do this in 
real life and then look at the Diary class for any method that might help you.   
write a method deleteLibraryReservation() that is passed a reservation number and deletes the 
corresponding reservation from the reservation system.
